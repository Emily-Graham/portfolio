Aim:
- to build a website the pays homage to pixel art games
- pay attention to viewer attention 
- apply parallax
- add fluid site animations

Note to self:
- rotating sections must be on a z-index of 1 for cursor interactivity to function (such as forms)

Questions/problems to address:
- can I fix the footer/contact section sizing using vh and px?
- unexpected behaviour in scrolling 
-- sometimes, the page does not scroll, needs to be tested in pages/across browsers
