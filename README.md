CURRENTLY BEING REDONE IN VUE! Can't wait to get all the art assets finished and working XD

Aim:
- to build a website the pays homage to pixel art games
- apply parallax
- add fluid site animations

Note to self:
- black filter layer fades in over navbar when not in use to improve visual hierachy
- skills will be a skill tree -- hover pops up info box (consider mobile alternative to hover)
- projects will be 'completed quests' -- clicking icons will give detail

Questions/problems to address:
- can I fix the footer/contact section sizing using vh and px?
- unexpected behaviour in scrolling - seems to be on refresh, linked to preloader
-- sometimes, the page does not scroll, needs to be tested in pages/across browsers
--issue found; scroll locks on refresh due to 'let's go' button
- how to fix preloader behaviour when on a different section? 
- how to create efficent code (cut down loading time)

Bonus Feature time permitting:
- landscape orientation layouts for mobile -- nav no-overflow right hand aligned
- dialouge system for about section
